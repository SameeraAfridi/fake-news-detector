This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Python, scikit-learn, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to text classification, specifically distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

✨ Key Highlights

📂 Dataset: Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)

🧹 Preprocessing: stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, lowercase normalization, URL removal

🔠 Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorization

🤖 Models:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Multinomial Naive Bayes (comparison)

📊 Evaluation: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

📝 Prediction: Classifies new text as Real or Fake

📚 Learnings & Takeaways

Preprocessing is crucial for NLP tasks (stopword removal, cleaning).

TF-IDF provides strong baseline features for text classification.

Logistic Regression performs surprisingly well on high-dimensional sparse text data.

Even a simple ML pipeline can achieve high accuracy on real-world datasets.

🚀 Future Work

Experiment with Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT).

Add a simple Flask/Django web app for live fake-news detection.

Deploy as an interactive demo using Streamlit or HuggingFace Spaces.
